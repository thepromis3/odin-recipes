    <h3>Description</h3>

        This dish is a go-to for all Japanese people. It's super easy to make,
        the ingredients are straightforward, and it's delicious. In terms of 
        taste, it's like a milder version of Indian curry, and you can put any
        type of meat (chicken and beef most common), and all types of vegetables.
        It can be had with rice, noodles, or bread, and at any time in the day.
